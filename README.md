# minecraft-server-rs

[New project.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0741586-d3eb-4d6c-8f25-804ccc14880f)

A Minecraft server control panel that is one binary, one config file, and no dependencies at runtime.

It does what Pterodactyl does for Minecraft specifically — install Java, download the server, run it, stream the console, edit the files, restart it when it crashes — without PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis, Docker or a separate node daemon.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nglmercer/minecraft-server-rs
cd minecraft-server-rs
./build.sh
./target/release/mcpanel --data-dir ./data --bind 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Or download a self-contained binary from [Releases](https://github.com/nglmercer/minecraft-server-rs/releases) (web UI is embedded). The first run prints a generated `admin` password — shown once.

Default bind is `127.0.0.1:8080` (loopback). For remote access keep it on loopback behind an HTTPS reverse proxy. Direct non-loopback plaintext HTTP requires `--allow-insecure-http` explicitly and is only for isolated networks. The port can be overridden without flags by writing a file at `<data-dir>/port` (or `<data-dir>/bind`) containing `8081` or `127.0.0.1:8081`; `--bind` / `MCPANEL_BIND` still wins when set. If the requested port is in use, a second launch opens the existing panel and exits, otherwise the next free port `8081-8099` is tried. The active `bind`/`url`/`pid` is written to `<data-dir>/.lock` while running.

On Windows, `mcpanel` also starts a small system-tray presence. Its first
milestone provides Open Panel and Exit; server controls and live status are
planned for later milestones.

Linux gets the same tray, but only in a build that opts into it: it needs GTK 3
and AppIndicator at load time, which a headless server has no reason to carry.
Take the `linux-x86_64-desktop` release asset, or build with
`cargo build --release -p panel --features panel/linux-tray`. The plain
`linux-x86_64` and static builds have no tray and no desktop dependencies. The
tray is opened from its menu (AppIndicator sends no click events of its own),
and `MCPANEL_NO_TRAY=1` turns it off on any platform.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `crates/guardian` | Lifecycle library. No HTTP, no panel concepts. |
| `crates/panel` | `mcpanel` binary: API, auth, embedded frontend. |
| `crates/tray` | Windows and Linux system-tray presence and panel lifecycle exit control. |
| `assets/mcp.ico` | Embedded tray icon. |
| `crates/playit-integration` | Embedded Playit runtime and optional daemon IPC. |
| `web` | Vite + Preact + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 frontend. |
| `vendor/java-path-rs` | Submodule: Java discovery and provisioning. |
| `vendor/minecraft-core-rs` | Submodule: server artifact resolution and download. |

Runtime lives under `--data-dir` (`panel.json`, `playit/secret.toml`, `jdks/`, `servers/<uuid>/`, `backups/<uuid>/`). Details in [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) and [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

On Linux install `bubblewrap` (`bwrap`) for the strongest sandbox; on macOS use
the available `sandbox-exec` helper. If the platform sandbox is unavailable,
Minecraft will not start unless you explicitly pass
`--allow-unsandboxed-servers` (or set `MCPANEL_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED_SERVERS=true`).
See [Security](docs/security.md) before granting untrusted operators access.

## Development

```sh
cargo run -p panel -- --data-dir ./data --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --dev-cors
cd web && npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :8080
```

`cargo dev-check` / `cargo dev-clippy` / `cargo workspace-test` are workspace aliases for the fast loop. See [Development](docs/development.md) and [Testing](docs/testing.md).

## API at a glance

Everything under `/api`. Browser sessions use `HttpOnly` session + CSRF cookies; API clients can use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Console and file downloads use short-lived one-use tickets (`POST .../ticket` → `GET .../download?ticket=`). Full table in [API](docs/api.md).

## Security

Four trust levels: panel admin ≈ host admin; server operator (scoped to assigned ids); untrusted plugin/mod (arbitrary JVM code); host administrator. File APIs are capability-based and reject traversal/symlink/hard-link attacks; Linux `bwrap` / macOS `sandbox-exec` sandbox each Minecraft process when available. Filesystem/API containment is not OS tenant isolation: plugins and mods execute arbitrary JVM code, and network access is not strongly isolated. See [Security](docs/security.md) before granting untrusted operators access.

## Status

Working end-to-end against a live Paper server — provisioning, supervision, crash recovery, console, file manager, backups, Modrinth installs, multi-user access, and Playit tunnels (embedded by default). Scheduled backups, Hangar/CurseForge, and persisted console buffer are not built yet. See [Releasing](docs/releasing.md).
