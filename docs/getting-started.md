# Getting Started

## Install

Build the migration branch from the fork. Existing [fork releases](https://github.com/hernan-lc/minecraft-server-rs/releases) predate this branch and do not include its Horizon integration. The web UI is embedded in the panel binary:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules --branch migrate/rust-horizon https://github.com/hernan-lc/minecraft-server-rs.git
cd minecraft-server-rs
./build.sh
./target/release/mcpanel --data-dir ./data --bind 127.0.0.1:8080
```

To install the native server and your prepared game files, follow the [Horizon migration guide](horizon-migration.md).

On Windows run the two steps `build.sh` wraps:

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
npm run build:native
```

Windows requires MSVC Build Tools. LLVM `lld-link` is optional. When available
on `PATH`, Rust commands automatically use it for faster linking; otherwise the
default MSVC linker is used:

```powershell
winget install -e --id LLVM.LLVM
```

Two Linux builds are published: `linux-x86_64` (glibc) and `linux-x86_64-static` (musl/static) for Alpine or older distros.

For Android, follow the [Termux installation guide](termux.md). Use the Android
ARM64 binary or build natively; Linux release binaries cannot run in Termux.

## First run

The first run prints a generated `admin` password. It is shown once — save it.

- Default bind is loopback (`127.0.0.1:8080`). For remote access keep it on loopback behind an HTTPS reverse proxy; see [Security — Secure remote deployment](security.md#secure-remote-deployment). Override without flags by writing `<data-dir>/port` (or `<data-dir>/bind`) containing `8081` or `127.0.0.1:8081`; `--bind` / `MCPANEL_BIND` still wins. If the port is busy, the panel opens the existing instance or tries the next free port `8081-8099`; the active address is written to `<data-dir>/.lock`.
- Direct non-loopback plaintext HTTP is refused unless `--allow-insecure-http` is supplied explicitly for a trusted, isolated network.
- On Linux install `bubblewrap` (`bwrap`) for the strongest sandbox; macOS uses `sandbox-exec` when available. If the helper is unavailable, Minecraft startup is refused unless `--allow-unsandboxed-servers` is supplied (or `MCPANEL_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED_SERVERS=true` is set). See [Security](security.md) and [Platforms](platforms.md).

## Data directory

Everything the panel owns at runtime lives under `--data-dir`:

```
data/
├── panel.json          users and server records
├── playit/             embedded Playit state
│   └── secret.toml     dedicated Playit secret (never in panel.json)
├── jdks/               JDKs downloaded on demand, shared by all servers
├── servers/<uuid>/     one server's working directory (worlds, plugins, jar)
└── backups/<uuid>/     server backups
```

On Unix the directory should be `0700` and owned by the panel service account; `panel.json` and `playit/secret.toml` are written owner-only. Do not place it in a shared directory.

## Next steps

- [Architecture](architecture.md) — crate layout and why the stack is this size.
- [Development](development.md) — run backend + Vite dev server side by side.
- [Playit](playit.md) — expose a server without port-forwarding.
- [Security](security.md) — threat model before granting operator access.
